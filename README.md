# bamazon

This is an entry-level mySQL application created in mySQL workbench, and called with node. The app takes in orders and deletes inventory as orders are placed. 

The store can also add (through a manager interface) back into inventory, create new items, view items with low stock (less than 5), and view all currently available items.

Rather unelegantly, you have to ctrl+c out of the interface every time. That will be edited out in the future, should I return to this project.
