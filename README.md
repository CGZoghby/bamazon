# bamazon

This is an entry-level mySQL application created in mySQL workbench, and called with node. The app takes in orders and deletes inventory as orders are placed. The store can also add back into inventory, and separately will be able to track sales across multiple bamazon departments and provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments.
